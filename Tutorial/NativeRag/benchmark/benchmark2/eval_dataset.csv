"## Usage tips

- The quickest way to get started with TrOCR is by checking the [tutorial
  notebooks](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/TrOCR), which show how to use the model
  at inference time as well as fine-tuning on custom data.
- TrOCR is pre-trained in 2 stages before being fine-tuned on downstream datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art results
  on both printed (e.g. the [SROIE dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sroie) and handwritten (e.g. the [IAM
  Handwriting dataset](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database>) text recognition tasks. For more
  information, see the [official models](https://huggingface.co/models?other=trocr>).
- TrOCR is always used within the [VisionEncoderDecoder](vision-encoder-decoder) framework.

## Resources

A list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by ðŸŒŽ) resources to help you get started with TrOCR. If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource.

<PipelineTag pipeline=""text-classification""/>","Which datasets does TrOCR achieve state-of-the-art results on?  
","TrOCR achieves state-of-the-art results on the SROIE dataset (printed text) and the IAM Handwriting dataset (handwritten text).","huggingface/transformers/blob/main/docs/source/en/model_doc/trocr.md","5","The context explicitly mentions that TrOCR achieves state-of-the-art results on both printed (e.g., the SROIE dataset) and handwritten (e.g., the IAM Handwriting dataset) text recognition tasks. This information directly answers the question unambiguously.
","5","This question is highly relevant to machine learning developers working with NLP applications, especially those using the Hugging Face ecosystem. TrOCR is a transformer-based OCR model, and knowing which datasets it performs well on can help developers choose the right model for their specific tasks. The question addresses a practical concern for developers looking to leverage state-of-the-art models for text recognition tasks.  
","5","The question is clear and self-contained, asking about the datasets where TrOCR (presumably a model or technology) achieves state-of-the-art results. It does not rely on any implicit context or additional information to be understood. Even if ""TrOCR"" is a technical term, the question is well-formed and can be answered by someone with access to relevant documentation or knowledge in the field.
